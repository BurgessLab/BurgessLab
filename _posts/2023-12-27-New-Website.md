Finally, thanks to the fantastic [Lab Website Template](https://github.com/greenelab/lab-website-template), I've been able to put together a nice looking lab website - welcome all! Many thanks to the [Greene Laboratory](https://github.com/greenelab) for putting together a markup-based website builder, that makes coding and updating a lab website quick and easy.

Our [official NICHD website](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/research/atNICHD/Investigators/burgess) has more detail (at least for now!), but is challenging to keep up-to-date.

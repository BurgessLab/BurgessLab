<!-- excerpt start -->
Danny was awarded a highly competitive NSF Graduate Research Fellowship! He'll be leaving the lab soon after almost two years as a Post-Baccalaureate fellow, to start his graduate work at Berkeley. We'll all be sad to see him go, but are delighted that his efforts have been recognized with this award!

Sreerag Othayoth Vasu completed his master's degree in physics from the National Institute of Technology, Trichy, India. After that, he joined the Laboratory for Neurobiology of Psychiatric Disorders at the University of Haifa in Israel as a PhD student. During his PhD, he mainly worked on transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and studied the underlying mechanism of axonal dynamics in tDCS-induced neuromodulation. Currently, Sreerag is a postdoctoral visiting fellow in the Burgess lab at NICHD, Bethesda, USA, and he is studying variability and robustness in zebrafish brain architecture.

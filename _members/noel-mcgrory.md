Noel grew up just outside of New York City and attended the University of Chicago, where he graduated this past year with majors in biology and neuroscience as well as a minor in computer science. During college, he worked in the Prince Lab, studying lateral line development in the zebrafish head, focusing on how interactions between distinct cellular populations guide the development of sensory systems. As an NIH Postbac, Noel is currently working to investigate neural circuits involved in prepulse inhibition, a sensorimotor gating system which affects startle responses. Noel currently plans to pursue an MD-PhD degree, focusing on research in neuroscience. Outside the lab, Noel enjoys reading fantasy novels, exploring DC, rock climbing, and ultimate frisbee.

Daniel Bazan earned his B.S. in Neuroscience in 2022 while engaging with behavioral and cognitive neuroscience, theranostic cancer research, and the characterization of octopus speciation through hemocyanin isoforms. Currently, he is a post-baccalaureate researcher at the NIH/NICHD in the Burgess lab, where his work involves characterizing structural covariation throughout the brain and identifying neuromodulators associated with waking arousal. Danielâ€™s overarching interests lie in understanding the neural mechanisms and systems that govern social dynamics, emotion, and learning.

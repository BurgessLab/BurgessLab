Madalina Andreea Robea earned her bachelor’s and master’s degrees from the ”Al.I.Cuza” University of Iasi, Romania, where she investigated the impact of certain environmental pollutants on zebrafish. Afterwards, she got her PhD diploma from the same university. During her doctoral research, she explored the ecotoxicological impact on zebrafish used as an animal model in the context of autism spectrum disorder. She was trained also in the Department of Medical Bioengineering at the University of Reykjavik, Iceland, and in the Department of Biology at the University of Aveiro, Portugal. At present, Madalina is working as a postdoc in the Burgess lab at NICHD, Bethesda, USA, where she is studying the effects of disregulated translation control on embryogenesis using zebrafish.

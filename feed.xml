<p>Harry and Reid visited Brown University in Providence, to teach a module at the Brown neuroscience graduate program. This year we presented students with a neurogenetic puzzle: could they identify the genes affected by morpholino knockdown, by examining morphological and behavioral phenotypes in embryonic zebrafish? Challenging, but ultimately many students correctly identified all the genes!

<p>Danny was awarded a highly competitive NSF Graduate Research Fellowship! He’ll be leaving the lab soon after almost two years as a Post-Baccalaureate fellow, to start his graduate work at Berkeley. We’ll all be sad to see him go, but are delighted that his efforts have been recognized with this award!

<p>Harry and Reid spent the week teaching students how to label and ablate Mauthner neurons. Brown University neuroscience graduate students visit Woods Hole to gain hands-on experience with different experimental systems. We had a great time interacting with students, and using a high speed camera to measure zebrafish and human startle latencies!

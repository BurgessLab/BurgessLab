<p>Harry and Reid spent the week teaching students how to label and ablate Mauthner neurons. Brown University neuroscience graduate students visit Woods Hole to gain hands-on experience with different experimental systems. We had a great time interacting with students, and using a high speed camera to measure zebrafish and human startle latencies!
